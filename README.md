# Stone-Paper-Scissors-Game
 This project is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users play against the computer, which randomly selects its move. The game displays the result (win, lose, or draw) after each round, with scores tracked throughout. The design is clean and responsive, offering a smooth, interactive experience.
